### bootstrap.sh:

Prepare the system with all needed packages. Need root permission for execute. 

What it does in detail:
- install all packages needed for building and running COTSon 
- configure some system parameters
- parsing the file repository image.list and generate the right directory in your system
  for store all shared file like HDD images and BSDS. For example, in a default configuration,
  bootstrap.sh generates the following directory:


    /opt/cotson/images
    /opt/cotson/dists
    /opt/cotson/bsds
    /opt/cotson/log

- run add-image.sh script for download the default HDD image (karmic64) and reset.bsd
- generates the bsds
### add-image.sh
Is an important utility for manage the COTSon HDD images. With this utility, is possible
add new image on our system and generate the bsds.
The list of the available images is contained in repository file: images.list
Need root permission for execute.
Some EXAMPLES:


    user@axm0:~/cotson$ ./add-images.sh trusty-axmv3
    user@axm0:~/cotson$ ./add-image.sh -l
    * Image list in repository:
    0. karmic64
    1. trusty-axmv3

    * Image list already downloaded:
    0. karmic64.img
    1. trusty-axmv3.img

    * BSD ready:
    0. 1p-karmic64.bsd
    1. 1p-karmic64-reset.bsd
    2. 1p-trusty-axmv3-boot
    3. 1p-trusty-axmv3.bsd
    4. 1p-trusty-axmv3-reset.bsd
    5. 2p-trusty-axmv3-boot
    6. 2p-trusty-axmv3.bsd
    7. 2p-trusty-axmv3-reset.bsd
    8. 4p-karmic64.bsd
    9. 4p-karmic64-reset.bsd
    10. 4p-trusty-axmv3-boot

1. Name of distribution
2. Version of distribution
3. Time in seconds for generate the bsd
4. Link to download the HDD images and reset.bsd
5. path for generating the system directory for store HDD images and bsds
6. MD5SUM of HDD image
