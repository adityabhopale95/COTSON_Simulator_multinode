QUICKSTART INSTRUCTIONS FOR LINUX
=============================================================================
1. Check that you are running one supported Linux release (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04)

2. Download AMD SimNow (e.g., simnow-linux64-4.6.2pub.tar.gz ) from here:
   http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/cpu-development/simnow-simulator/

3. Build COTSon
   ./configure && make release && make regression

4. You are now ready to use COTSon: you can jump to point
   "HOW TO GET MORE FAMILIAR WITH COTSon" below or
   (if anythng above goes wrong) read the detailed instructions below

=============================================================================
To build COTSon
=============================================================================

1. Download the latest AMD's SimNow platform emulator for linux.
   Visit http://developer.amd.com/cpu/simnow for details
   Unpack simnow to your preferred location 
   (for example /home/user/simnow-linux64-4.6.2pub)

   *** The SimNow tested version for this COTSon release is "4.6.2pub" ***

2. Run the toplevel 'configure' script with the simnow location
    ./configure --simnow_dir /home/user/simnow-linux64-4.6.2pub

   Note that this isn't a standard gnu 'configure', but a much simpler 
   script.  Because it also downloads & installs (with apt-get) the 
   required system components, you need to have 'sudo' privileges

   You can also override the standard cc (--cc) and c++ (--cxx) compilers.
   COTSon has been tested with up to gcc-4.4/g++-4.4

3. Build everything (the core COTSon tools and sample BSDs in data/), e.g.
    make release -j4   ## Build release (optimized) and 4 parallel jobs

   After a successful build
   - the COTSon binary (shared lib) is in
        src/abaeterno/abaeterno.so
   - the COTSon network binary (executable) is in
        src/network/mediator
   - the guest tools (installable tarball or .deb) are in
        data/cotson-guest-tools.iso
   - the test BSDs are in 
        data/1p.bsd (1 CPU) 
		data/4p.bsd (4 CPUs)
	 the BSDs are both saved at the "root" bash prompt after 
	 booting a 64b Ubuntu "karmic" minimal installation, so 
	 that you can send keyboard commands to start benchmarks

   If you then want to install the COTSon binaries to the default
   sbin location (for example, for a distributed simulation), you can
   then run
       make install           ## Install binaries in default dir

4. Run the regression test:
       make regression

   If everything is OK you should see a line which says that all tests
   went well. If not, first try to **relaunch the test again** since
   the reason of the failure may be only a temporary mismatch in the
   statistics (since the execution of the full-system simulation 
   may be -- like in reality -- not 100% deterministic)

   Do not forget to update the regression tests in case you modify
   any of the source files! To do so:
       cd src
       make regression        ## creates the test_@all.log file
       make update-regression ## updates the tests with the local output
       make regression        ## the 2nd time around you should get no errors

5. (Optionally) You may also run 10 examples in non-interactive mode
   in order to check that the installation was done properly and your machine
   supports their execution:
       make run_example_regression

============================================================================
HOW TO GET MORE FAMILIAR WITH COTSon
============================================================================
1. Have a look at the "COTSon USER GUIDE" in the doc directory.
   You can follow the examples in the src directory that are illustrated
   in the User Guide and also study the .in COTSon configuration files.

2. Once you have studied a bit the guide, try also to run yourself 
   the examples:

       cd src/examples && make  or simply: make run_examples

   Follow the makefile instructions and look at the output 
   (the 'copy_files' directive will copy logfiles to the local directory))
   A few of the examples may require some amount of babysitting to run.
   The "twonodes" example is a simple 2-node ping in cluster mode.
   The "sqlite" example shows how to dump (and read) metrics to a database.
   The "tracer" example (in its own dir) shows guest/simulation interaction.

3. If you want to store the results in a postgres or sqlite database, take 
   a look at src/tools/pg_install and read the documentation how to
   configure a database 'heartbeat'. There is also an example with sqlite in
   src/examples/sqlite.in

=============================================================================
IMPORTANT SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
=============================================================================

SimNow requires a large addressable virtual memory space. Ensure that
vm.max_map_count is appropriately configured in /etc/sysctl.conf.
You can check the value with
    sysctl vm.max_map_count

Here are some recommended values: 
- for a large memory machine, 16GB and up
    vm.max_map_count=16777216
- for a moderate memory machine, 4-8GB
    vm.max_map_count=1048576

In addition, if you're running clustered simulations, it may be better
to also tune for TCP/IP and add to /etc/sysctl.conf

    net.core.rmem_default = 262144 
    net.core.wmem_default = 262144 
    net.core.rmem_max = 262144 
    net.core.wmem_max = 262144
    net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 262144 
    net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 87380 262144 
    net.ipv4.tcp_sack = 0 
    net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0 
    net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 1024 65000

And while you're at it, you might also do these (optional, more
appropriate for large memory machines)

    kernel.shmall = 2097152 
    kernel.shmmax = 2147483648 
    kernel.shmmni = 4096 
    kernel.sem = 250 32000 100 128 
    fs.file-max = 3241615
