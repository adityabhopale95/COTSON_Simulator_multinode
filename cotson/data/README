This directory contains a few samples BSDs and an example
on how to create a disk image. Because SimNow can use raw
disk images as well, an easy way to create a disk image
for a guest OS is to use an external virtualizer, such as 
qemu/kvm (which is the provided example).

In the example makefile the 'vmbuild' script uses 
Ubuntu's 'vmbuilder' facility to invoke debootstrap 
and create a barebone karmic (ubuntu 9.10) image with 
a minimal installation. After conversion to 'raw' format
the disk image can then be used as a SimNow disk.

The disk can obviously also be used by kvm/qemu with 
run-kvm.sh, to then make successive modifications.

The 'test' directory contain traces used by the regression 
tests with the abaeterno injector.
