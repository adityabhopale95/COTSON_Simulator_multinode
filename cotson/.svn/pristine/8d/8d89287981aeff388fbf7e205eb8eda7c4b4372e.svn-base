Example to invoke a custom simulation 'tracer' from a guest application

Cotson can be used and modified to receive input from inside the guest system. 
This is a simple example that shows you how to do so. 

This example file 'cotson_tracer.in' is an example of the exit_trigger
functionality. The exit_trigger tells cotson that you want the simulation to
end when a particular file appears in the host enviroment. We then use the
send_keyboard function to instruct the internal system to produce a file (touch
x) and send it outside (using xput) into this exit trigger and the end of the
simulation. This is a way of allowing simulation to take place for complete
applications.
