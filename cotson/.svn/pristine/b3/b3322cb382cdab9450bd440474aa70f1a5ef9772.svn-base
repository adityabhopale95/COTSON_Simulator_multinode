## we call tracer_app twice -- note the different parameter
## We have previously subscribed to 'callback 1234' (our MAGIC number)
## (in tracer-example.cpp) so our tracer example gets called. 
## As we are using no_timing only the functional callback gets invoked

xget $D/tracer_app /tmp/tracer_app
chmod +x /tmp/tracer_app

## First call to the custom tracer (in functional mode)
## '1234' is the MAGIC number associated with this callback
## 2 and 3 are two parameters to play with
/tmp/tracer_app 1234 2 3

## Call "10" is reserved for the selective sampler
## cotson_tracer is part of the guest tools, preinstalled in the BSD
## '10' is the MAGIC number associated with this callback
## 1 represents the 'zone' where timing is needed
## last parameters is the timing switch (0 --> FUNCTIONAL+TIMING)
cotson_tracer 10 1 0   ## switch to timing

## Second call to the custom tracer (in timing mode)
## '1234' is the MAGIC number associated with this callback
## 4 and 5 are two parameters to play with
/tmp/tracer_app 1234 4 5

## Call "10" is reserved for the selective sampler
## cotson_tracer is part of the guest tools, preinstalled in the BSD
## '10' is the MAGIC number associated with this callback
## 1 represents the 'zone' where timing is needed
## last parameters switches back to functional only (1 --> ONLY_FUNCTIONAL)
cotson_tracer 10 1 1  ## back to functional
